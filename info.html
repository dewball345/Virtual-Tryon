        <h1>Virtual Tryon?</h1>
        <h3>Virtual Tryon is the use of smartphones for testing and trying out wearables via device(and not in-person) before buying.</h3>
        <h1>You can see two buttons in the home screen. The first one stops/pauses video, and the second one starts/resumes video.</h1>
        <h2>Make sure that your face can be seen clearly, be, ideally 1-2 feet from the camera, and click the second button</h2>
        <h2>Wait for the program to load.</h2>
        <h3>When the loader stops, you should see a difference to your face. This is due to lighting problems.</h3>
        <h1>On the right of the program you will see a black bar with the names Earrings, Necklace, Nosering, and Bottu. Click these black bars to see some options</h1>
